# Advent of Code

If you don't know Advent of Code is - it's this beautiful initiative where you have to solve a puzzle every day from December 1st to December 25th each year. The puzzles are divided in two parts and you can earn a star for each part you solve. The puzzles can be solved in any programming language and you can find them [here](https://adventofcode.com).

This repository serves as my container for all my tries at solving the puzzles.
Some of the solutions are clever some not so much, be warned :sweat_smile:
